A few Multiple District 410 2020 Convention payment related items
Good day,

thank you again for registering for the Lions Multiple District 410 2020 Convention. 

This email is mainly a reminder that full payment should ideally be made by the end of March for the upcoming convention. If you have any queries about payments, especially if you have made a payment you haven't received an acknowledgement for, please contact registration secretary Kim van Wyk on 083 384 4260 or vanwykk@gmail.com.

We also received a payment on 24 February with the reference "CAPITEC F RUTLIDGE". This doesn't tie up with the name of anyone registered for the convention. Please contact registration secretary Kim van Wyk on 083 384 4260 or vanwykk@gmail.com if you have any details on this payment.

Thank you
The 2020 MD410 Convention Organising Committee
